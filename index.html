    <title>Patched Apps F-Droid repository</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>F-Droid repository including patched or unavailable apps, to centralise everything on F-Droid. <br> <br> 
    This F-Droid repository tries to solve a huge problem. <br>
    The Android Open-Source Community is awesome, and while standard Android as you get it (Apart from brands like Fairphone, Shiftphone or Resellers like Nitrophone) is literally a tracking instrument for advertisers, you can have a pretty secure and well-working device, without any tracking. <br><br>
    Apart from... the 10% of closed source apps you would Download from the PlayStore. The Playstore is full of tracking apps and malware, and doesnt work on Googlefree devices. I collected a few apps I personally find no FOSS replacement for, edited them with LuckyPatcher (if I find the time there will be an open-source solution) and now I want to share them with as many people as possible!
